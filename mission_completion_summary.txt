IMPACT
========================================

Before: Many weeks had gaps, with missions only at certain
        difficulty levels, making progression uneven.

After:  Weeks 2-14 now have comprehensive difficulty progressions,
        providing smooth learning paths from beginner through
        expert/master levels.

All weeks now support the goal of "equitable distribution of
missions ranging from beginner to master."
