  - id: "get-powershell-version"
    title: "Check PowerShell Version"
    description: |
      PowerShell uses a special variable `$PSVersionTable` to show version information.

      Type the following command to see your PowerShell version:
      ```powershell
      $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
      ```

      This will display the version of PowerShell you're running.
    hint: "Remember PowerShell variables start with $"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "$PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "5"

  - id: "write-output"
    title: "Display Text with Write-Output"
    description: |
      The `Write-Output` cmdlet sends output to the pipeline.

      Try this command:
      ```powershell
      Write-Output "Hello, PowerShell!"
      ```

      You should see your message displayed.
    hint: "Cmdlets follow the Verb-Noun naming convention"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "Write-Output 'Hello, PowerShell!'"
      matcher: "exact"
      expected: "Hello, PowerShell!"

  - id: "get-location"
    title: "Find Your Current Location"
    description: |
      Just like `pwd` in Linux, PowerShell uses `Get-Location` to show your current directory.

      Execute:
      ```powershell
      Get-Location
      ```

      This shows your working directory path.
    hint: "You can also use the alias 'pwd'"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "Get-Location | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Path"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "learner"

  - id: "list-items"
    title: "List Files and Folders"
    description: |
      `Get-ChildItem` lists the contents of a directory (like `ls` in Linux).

      List the contents of your current directory:
      ```powershell
      Get-ChildItem
      ```

      Right now it might be empty, but you'll see files as we create them.
    hint: "The alias 'dir' also works"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "Get-ChildItem | Measure-Object | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Count"
      matcher: "regex"
      expected: "\\d+"

  - id: "create-file"
    title: "Create Your First File"
    description: |
      Let's create a text file using `New-Item`:

      ```powershell
      New-Item -Path test.txt -ItemType File -Value "My first file"
      ```

      This creates a file called `test.txt` with some content.
    hint: "-ItemType File creates a file, -ItemType Directory creates a folder"
    validation:
      type: "file-exists"
      file: "C:/learner/test.txt"
      matcher: "exists"

completion:
  message: "🎉 Congratulations! You've executed your first PowerShell commands. You're ready to dive deeper into PowerShell!"
