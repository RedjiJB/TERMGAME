  description: '**Listing Files with ls**


    The `ls` command lists directory contents.


    **Basic usage:**

    ```bash

    ls              # List current directory

    ls /path        # List specific directory

    ls -l           # Long format (detailed)

    ls -a           # Show hidden files (starting with .)

    ls -lh          # Human-readable sizes

    ls -lt          # Sort by modification time

    ls -lS          # Sort by size

    ```


    **Combining options:**

    ```bash

    ls -lah         # Long format, all files, human-readable

    ls -ltr         # Long format, sorted by time, reversed

    ```


    **Task:** Practice listing files.


    ```bash

    mkdir -p ~/file_ops

    cd ~/file_ops


    # Create test files

    touch file1.txt file2.txt .hidden

    echo "data" > file3.txt


    # Document ls usage

    echo "Listing Files" > ls_demo.txt

    echo "=============" >> ls_demo.txt

    echo "" >> ls_demo.txt


    echo "Basic listing:" >> ls_demo.txt

    ls >> ls_demo.txt


    echo "" >> ls_demo.txt

    echo "With hidden files (-a):" >> ls_demo.txt

    ls -a >> ls_demo.txt


    echo "" >> ls_demo.txt

    echo "Long format (-l):" >> ls_demo.txt

    ls -l *.txt >> ls_demo.txt


    cat ls_demo.txt

    ```

    '
  hint: 'Use ''ls -lah'' as your default - it shows all files, detailed info, and

    human-readable sizes. The -a flag reveals hidden files starting with dot.

- id: viewing-files
  description: '**Viewing File Contents**


    **Commands for viewing:**

    ```bash

    cat file.txt        # Display entire file

    head file.txt       # First 10 lines

    head -n 5 file.txt  # First 5 lines

    tail file.txt       # Last 10 lines

    tail -n 5 file.txt  # Last 5 lines

    less file.txt       # Page through file (press q to quit)

    ```


    **Useful tricks:**

    ```bash

    cat file1.txt file2.txt  # Concatenate multiple files

    tail -f log.txt          # Follow file (watch new lines)

    ```


    **Task:** View files different ways.


    ```bash

    # Create test file with content

    cat > sample.txt << ''EOF''

    Line 1

    Line 2

    Line 3

    Line 4

    Line 5

    Line 6

    Line 7

    Line 8

    Line 9

    Line 10

    EOF


    echo "Viewing Files" > view_demo.txt

    echo "=============" >> view_demo.txt

    echo "" >> view_demo.txt


    echo "First 3 lines:" >> view_demo.txt

    head -n 3 sample.txt >> view_demo.txt


    echo "" >> view_demo.txt

    echo "Last 3 lines:" >> view_demo.txt

    tail -n 3 sample.txt >> view_demo.txt


    cat view_demo.txt

    ```

    '
  hint: 'Use ''cat'' for small files, ''less'' for large files. ''head'' shows the
    start,

    ''tail'' shows the end. tail -f is great for monitoring log files.

- id: copying-files
  description: '**Copying Files and Directories**


    **Basic copying:**

    ```bash

    cp source dest          # Copy file

    cp file1 file2 dir/     # Copy multiple files to directory

    cp -r dir1 dir2         # Copy directory recursively

    cp -i file dest         # Interactive (prompt before overwrite)

    cp -v file dest         # Verbose (show what''s being copied)

    ```


    **Useful options:**

    ```bash

    cp -p file dest         # Preserve permissions and timestamps

    cp -u file dest         # Copy only if source is newer

    ```


    **Task:** Practice copying.


    ```bash

    mkdir -p source dest


    echo "Original" > source/file1.txt

    echo "Data" > source/file2.txt

    mkdir source/subdir


    echo "Copying Files" > copy_demo.txt

    echo "=============" >> copy_demo.txt

    echo "" >> copy_demo.txt


    # Copy single file

    cp source/file1.txt dest/

    echo "Copied file1.txt to dest/" >> copy_demo.txt


    # Copy multiple files

    cp source/file*.txt dest/

    echo "Copied all .txt files" >> copy_demo.txt


    # Copy directory

    cp -r source dest/source_backup

    echo "Copied entire source directory" >> copy_demo.txt


    echo "" >> copy_demo.txt

    echo "Destination contents:" >> copy_demo.txt

    ls -R dest/ >> copy_demo.txt


    cat copy_demo.txt

    ```

    '
  hint: 'Use ''cp -r'' for directories, ''cp -i'' to avoid accidental overwrites.

    The -r flag means "recursive" - it copies everything inside.

- id: moving-renaming
  description: '**Moving and Renaming Files**


    `mv` both moves and renames files (they''re the same operation!).


    **Basic usage:**

    ```bash

    mv old new              # Rename file

    mv file dir/            # Move file to directory

    mv file1 file2 dir/     # Move multiple files

    mv -i source dest       # Interactive (prompt before overwrite)

    mv -v source dest       # Verbose

    ```


    **Renaming multiple files:**

    ```bash

    mv file.txt file.bak         # Rename

    mv *.txt backup/             # Move all .txt files

    ```


    **Task:** Practice moving and renaming.


    ```bash

    mkdir move_test


    touch file_a.txt file_b.txt file_c.txt


    echo "Moving and Renaming" > move_demo.txt

    echo "===================" >> move_demo.txt

    echo "" >> move_demo.txt


    echo "Initial files:" >> move_demo.txt

    ls *.txt >> move_demo.txt


    # Rename

    mv file_a.txt file_alpha.txt

    echo "" >> move_demo.txt

    echo "After renaming file_a.txt → file_alpha.txt:" >> move_demo.txt

    ls file_*.txt >> move_demo.txt


    # Move to directory

    mv file_b.txt move_test/

    echo "" >> move_demo.txt

    echo "After moving file_b.txt to move_test/:" >> move_demo.txt

    echo "Current dir:" >> move_demo.txt

    ls file*.txt 2>/dev/null || echo "(file_b.txt moved)" >> move_demo.txt

    echo "move_test dir:" >> move_demo.txt

    ls move_test/ >> move_demo.txt


    cat move_demo.txt

    ```

    '
  hint: 'mv is used for both moving AND renaming. If the destination is a directory,

    it moves. If it''s a new name, it renames. Simple!

- id: deleting-files
  description: '**Removing Files and Directories**


    **Removing files:**

    ```bash

    rm file.txt             # Remove file

    rm file1 file2 file3    # Remove multiple files

    rm -i file.txt          # Interactive (ask confirmation)

    rm -f file.txt          # Force (no confirmation)

    rm *.txt                # Remove all .txt files

    ```


    **Removing directories:**

    ```bash

    rmdir empty_dir         # Remove empty directory

    rm -r directory         # Remove directory and contents

    rm -rf directory        # Force remove (DANGEROUS!)

    ```


    **SAFETY TIP: Always double-check before using rm -rf!**


    **Task:** Practice safe deletion.


    ```bash

    mkdir cleanup

    touch cleanup/temp1.txt cleanup/temp2.txt

    mkdir cleanup/subdir


    echo "Deleting Files Safely" > delete_demo.txt

    echo "=====================" >> delete_demo.txt

    echo "" >> delete_demo.txt


    echo "Before cleanup:" >> delete_demo.txt

    ls -R cleanup/ >> delete_demo.txt


    # Remove single file

    rm cleanup/temp1.txt

    echo "" >> delete_demo.txt

    echo "After removing temp1.txt:" >> delete_demo.txt

    ls cleanup/ >> delete_demo.txt


    # Remove directory

    rmdir cleanup/subdir

    echo "" >> delete_demo.txt

    echo "After removing empty subdir:" >> delete_demo.txt

    ls cleanup/ >> delete_demo.txt


    echo "" >> delete_demo.txt

    echo "Safety tips:" >> delete_demo.txt

    echo "✓ Use -i for confirmation" >> delete_demo.txt

    echo "✓ Check with ls before rm" >> delete_demo.txt

    echo "✗ Never use rm -rf / or rm -rf /*" >> delete_demo.txt


    cat delete_demo.txt

    ```

    '
  hint: 'ALWAYS use ''rm -i'' when deleting important files. It asks for confirmation.

    Use ''ls'' first to verify you''re deleting the right files!

  description: '**Using Wildcards**


    Wildcards match multiple files:


    **Pattern matching:**

    ```bash

    *           # Match any characters

    ?           # Match single character

    [abc]       # Match one of: a, b, or c

    [a-z]       # Match range: a through z

    [!abc]      # Match any except a, b, c

    ```


    **Examples:**

    ```bash

    ls *.txt              # All files ending in .txt

    ls file?.txt          # file1.txt, fileA.txt, etc.

    ls [abc]*.txt         # Files starting with a, b, or c

    ls file[0-9].txt      # file0.txt through file9.txt

    rm temp*              # Remove all files starting with temp

    ```


    **Task:** Practice wildcards.


    ```bash

    # Create test files

    touch report1.txt report2.txt report3.txt

    touch data_a.csv data_b.csv data_c.csv

    touch archive2024.zip archive2023.zip


    echo "Wildcard Patterns" > wildcard_demo.txt

    echo "=================" >> wildcard_demo.txt

    echo "" >> wildcard_demo.txt


    echo "All .txt files:" >> wildcard_demo.txt

    ls *.txt >> wildcard_demo.txt


    echo "" >> wildcard_demo.txt

    echo "Files matching data_?.csv:" >> wildcard_demo.txt

    ls data_?.csv >> wildcard_demo.txt


    echo "" >> wildcard_demo.txt

    echo "Reports (report[0-9].txt):" >> wildcard_demo.txt

    ls report[0-9].txt >> wildcard_demo.txt


    cat wildcard_demo.txt

    ```


    **Congratulations!** You''ve mastered file operations!


    **You learned:**

    - Listing files (ls with various options)

    - Viewing files (cat, head, tail, less)

    - Copying files and directories (cp, cp -r)

    - Moving and renaming (mv)

    - Deleting files safely (rm, rmdir)

    - Using wildcards for pattern matching


    **Essential commands:**

    - ls -lah: List all files with details

    - cp -r: Copy directories

    - mv: Move or rename

    - rm -i: Remove with confirmation

    - Use wildcards (*,?) for batch operations


    You now have the core skills for file management in Linux!

    '
  hint: 'Wildcards expand before the command runs. ''ls *.txt'' becomes ''ls file1.txt

    file2.txt file3.txt''. Test with ls before using with rm!
