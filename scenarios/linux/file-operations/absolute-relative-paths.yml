  description: 'An absolute path starts from the root directory (/) and specifies

    the complete path to a file or directory.


    Use an absolute path to display the contents of data.csv:

    cat /home/learner/data/input/data.csv


    Absolute paths work from anywhere in the file system.

    Navigate to the project directory, then use a relative path to list src:

    cd /home/learner/project

    ls src


    ''src'' is relative to /home/learner/project

    From /home/learner/project/src, access the docs directory:

    cd /home/learner/project/src

    ls ../docs


    The .. goes up to ''project'', then into ''docs''.

    From the project directory, list the current directory explicitly:

    cd /home/learner/project

    ls .


    This is equivalent to just ''ls'' but shows the concept.

    From /home/learner/project/src/components, access the data directory:

    cd /home/learner/project/src/components

    ls ../../../data


    This goes up 3 levels then into data.

    From anywhere, access a file using ~:

  message: 'Excellent! You now understand paths:

    - Absolute paths: Start with / (e.g., /home/learner/file.txt)

    - Relative paths: Start from current directory (e.g., ../docs)

    - . = current directory

    - .. = parent directory

    - ~ = home directory


    Mastering paths is essential for efficient Linux navigation!
