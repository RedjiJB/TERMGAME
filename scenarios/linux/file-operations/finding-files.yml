  title: Find Files by Name
  description: 'The ''find'' command searches for files and directories.


    Find all files named ''README.md'' starting from your home directory:

    find ~ -name "README.md"


    The -name option searches for exact filename matches.

  hint: 'Type: find ~ -name ''README.md'''
  validation:
    type: command-output
    command: find /home/learner -name 'README.md' 2>/dev/null
    matcher: contains

- id: find-by-extension
  title: Find Files by Extension
  description: 'Use wildcards (*) to find files by extension.


    Find all Python files (.py) in the project directory:

    find ~/project -name "*.py"


    The * matches any characters before .py

    '
  hint: 'Type: find ~/project -name ''*.py'''
  validation:
    type: command-output
    command: find /home/learner/project -name '*.py' 2>/dev/null | wc -l
    matcher: contains
    expected: '3'
- id: find-by-type
  title: Find Directories Only
  description: 'Use -type to specify what you''re searching for.


    Find all directories in the project folder:

    find ~/project -type d


    -type d finds directories, -type f finds regular files.

    '
  hint: 'Type: find ~/project -type d'
  validation:
    type: command-output
    command: find /home/learner/project -type d 2>/dev/null | grep tests
    matcher: contains
    expected: tests
- id: find-case-insensitive
  title: Case-Insensitive Search
  description: 'Use -iname for case-insensitive filename searches.


    Find files named ''readme'' (any case):

    find ~/project -iname "readme*"


    This matches README.md, Readme.txt, readme.md, etc.

    '
  hint: 'Type: find ~/project -iname ''readme*'''
  validation:
    type: command-output
    command: find /home/learner/project -iname 'readme*' 2>/dev/null
    matcher: contains
    expected: README.md
- id: find-with-path
  title: Find Files in Specific Path
  description: 'Use -path to match part of the file''s path.


    Find all files in directories containing ''src'':

    find ~ -path "*/src/*" -type f


    This finds files where ''src'' appears in the path.

    '
  hint: 'Type: find ~ -path ''*/src/*'' -type f'
  validation:
    type: command-output
    command: find /home/learner -path '*/src/*' -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l
    matcher: contains
    expected: '2'
- id: find-multiple-names
  title: Find Multiple Filenames
  description: 'Use -o (OR operator) to find multiple patterns.


    Find all .py and .md files:

    find ~/project -name "*.py" -o -name "*.md"


    -o means "or" - matches either pattern.

    '
  hint: 'Type: find ~/project -name ''*.py'' -o -name ''*.md'''
  validation:
    type: command-output
    command: find /home/learner/project \( -name '*.py' -o -name '*.md' \) 2>/dev/null
      | wc -l
    matcher: contains
    expected: '4'
completion:
  message: 'Great job! You''ve learned to find files using:

    - find -name: search by filename

    - find -type: search by type (f=file, d=directory)

    - find -iname: case-insensitive search

    - find -path: search by path pattern

    - Wildcards (*) for pattern matching


    The find command is one of the most powerful tools for locating files!
