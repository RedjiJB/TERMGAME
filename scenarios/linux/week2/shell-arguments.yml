environment:
  image: "ubuntu:22.04"
  workdir: "/home/learner"
  setup:
    - "mkdir -p /home/learner/practice"
    - "touch /home/learner/practice/file1.txt"
    - "touch /home/learner/practice/file2.txt"
    - "echo 'Hello World' > /home/learner/practice/file1.txt"

steps:
  - id: "simple-argument"
    title: "Pass an Argument to a Command"
    description: |
      Commands take arguments to specify what they should operate on.
      Use 'cat file1.txt' to display the contents of file1.txt in the practice directory.

      First, navigate to the practice directory: cd practice
      Then use cat with the filename as an argument.
    hint: "Run: cd practice && cat file1.txt"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "cat /home/learner/practice/file1.txt"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "Hello World"

  - id: "option-long-format"
    title: "Use Options with Commands"
    description: |
      Options modify how commands behave. They usually start with - (dash).
      Use 'ls -l' to list files in long format showing detailed information.

      Options can be combined: -l for long format, -a for all files (including hidden).
    hint: "Type: ls -l"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "ls -l /home/learner/practice | grep file1"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "file1.txt"

  - id: "multiple-options"
    title: "Combine Multiple Options"
    description: |
      Multiple options can be combined in two ways:
      - Separate: ls -l -a
      - Combined: ls -la

      Use 'ls -lh' to show files in long format with human-readable sizes.
      The -h option makes file sizes easier to read (KB, MB instead of bytes).
    hint: "Type: ls -lh /home/learner/practice"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "ls -lh /home/learner/practice | wc -l"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "3"

  - id: "option-with-value"
    title: "Options That Take Values"
    description: |
      Some options require a value. For example, 'head -n 5' shows first 5 lines.

      Create a test file and use head -n 1 to show just the first line.
      Run: echo -e "Line1\nLine2\nLine3" > test.txt
      Then: head -n 1 test.txt
    hint: "Run the echo command first, then: head -n 1 test.txt"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "echo -e 'Line1\nLine2\nLine3' > /tmp/test.txt && head -n 1 /tmp/test.txt"
      matcher: "exact"
      expected: "Line1"

    Excellent! You now understand:
    - Arguments specify what commands operate on
    - Options modify command behavior
    - Options can be combined (-la is same as -l -a)
    - Some options take values (-n 5)

    These fundamentals are essential for using any Linux command effectively!
