      Print the PATH environment variable using 'echo $PATH'.

      PATH is a crucial environment variable that tells the shell where to look
      for executable programs. When you type a command, the shell searches these
      directories in order.
    hint: "Type 'echo $PATH' to see the directories in your PATH"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "echo $PATH"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "/usr/bin"

    title: "List All Environment Variables"
    description: |
      Use the 'env' command to see all environment variables currently set.

      Environment variables store configuration and state information that
      programs can access. They affect how your shell and programs behave.
    hint: "Type 'env' to display all environment variables"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "env"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "PATH"

    description: |
      Use the 'whoami' command to print your current username.

      This simple but useful command tells you which user account you're
      currently logged in as. Important for multi-user systems and debugging
      permission issues.
    hint: "Type 'whoami' to see your username"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "whoami"
      matcher: "exact"
      expected: "root"

  - id: "check-home-directory"
    title: "View Your Home Directory"
    description: |
      Print the HOME environment variable to see your home directory path.

      Every user has a home directory where their personal files are stored.
      The $HOME variable always points to this location.
    hint: "Use 'echo $HOME' to see your home directory path"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "echo $HOME"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "/root"
