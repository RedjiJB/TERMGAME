environment:
  image: "ubuntu:22.04"
  workdir: "/home/learner"
  setup:
    - "apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq man-db manpages > /dev/null 2>&1"
    - "mkdir -p /home/learner"

steps:
  - id: "use-help-flag"
    title: "Use the --help Flag"
    description: |
      Most Linux commands support a --help flag that shows basic usage information.
      Try running 'ls --help' to see the help output for the ls command.

      This is the quickest way to get a brief overview of a command's options.
    hint: "Type 'ls --help' and look for the output"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "ls --help"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "Usage"

  - id: "read-man-page"
    title: "Read a Manual Page"
    description: |
      Use 'man ls' to open the full manual page for the ls command.
      Then verify you can access it by checking if man is available.

      Manual pages (man pages) provide comprehensive documentation for commands,
      including detailed descriptions, all options, and examples.
    hint: "Type 'man ls' to open the manual (press 'q' to quit if it opens)"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "man ls 2>&1 | head -n 1"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "LS"

  - id: "search-man-pages"
    title: "Search Manual Pages"
    description: |
      Use 'man -k directory' to search for commands related to directories.

      The -k flag searches manual page descriptions for the given keyword.
      This helps you discover commands when you know what you want to do
      but don't know which command to use.
    hint: "Try 'man -k directory' to search for directory-related commands"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "man -k directory"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "mkdir"

  - id: "use-apropos"
    title: "Discover Commands with apropos"
    description: |
      The 'apropos' command is equivalent to 'man -k' and searches manual pages.
      Use 'apropos copy' to find commands related to copying.

      Apropos is helpful when you're learning and want to discover new commands
      for specific tasks.
    hint: "Type 'apropos copy' to find copy-related commands"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "apropos copy"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "cp"
