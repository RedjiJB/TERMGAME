environment:
  image: "ubuntu:22.04"
  workdir: "/home/learner"
  setup:
    - "mkdir -p /home/learner"
    - "echo -e 'Welcome to TermGame!\nThis is a training platform.\nYou are learning Linux basics.' > /home/learner/welcome.txt"
    - "seq 1 100 > /home/learner/numbers.txt"
    - "echo -e 'Linux\nUnix\nWindows\nMacOS' > /home/learner/systems.txt"

steps:
  - id: "view-with-cat"
    title: "View File with cat"
    description: |
      View the contents of welcome.txt using the 'cat' command.

      The 'cat' command displays the entire file content at once.
      It's perfect for small files that fit on one screen.
    hint: "Type 'cat welcome.txt' to view the file"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "cat welcome.txt"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "Welcome to TermGame"

  - id: "view-first-lines"
    title: "View First Lines with head"
    description: |
      Use the 'head' command to view the first 5 lines of numbers.txt.

      The head command is useful when you only need to see the beginning of a file,
      especially helpful for large files or log files.
    hint: "Try 'head -n 5 numbers.txt' to see the first 5 lines"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "head -n 5 numbers.txt"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "1"

  - id: "view-last-lines"
    title: "View Last Lines with tail"
    description: |
      Now use the 'tail' command to view the last 3 lines of systems.txt.

      The tail command shows the end of a file, which is particularly useful for
      viewing the most recent entries in log files.
    hint: "Use 'tail -n 3 systems.txt' to see the last 3 lines"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "tail -n 3 systems.txt"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "MacOS"

  - id: "count-lines"
    title: "Count Lines in File"
    description: |
      Use 'wc -l' to count how many lines are in numbers.txt.

      The 'wc' (word count) command with -l flag counts lines.
      Verify that numbers.txt has 100 lines.
    hint: "Type 'wc -l numbers.txt' and check the output"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "wc -l numbers.txt"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "100"

completion:
  message: "Excellent! You now know how to view file contents using cat, head, tail, and count lines with wc."
