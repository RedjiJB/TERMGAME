      Use 'ps' to list processes running in your current terminal session.

      ps (process status) is the fundamental tool for viewing running processes.
      Without options, it shows only processes in your current shell.
    hint: "Type 'ps' to see your current processes"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "ps"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "PID"

      Use 'ps aux' to see all processes running on the system.

      The 'aux' flags show: 'a' = all users, 'u' = user-oriented format,
      'x' = including processes not attached to terminals. This is the most
      common way to view all processes.
    hint: "Type 'ps aux' to see all processes"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "ps aux | head -n 1"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "USER"

  - id: "find-specific-process"
    title: "Find a Specific Process"
    description: |
      Use 'ps aux | grep bash' to find all bash processes.

      Combining ps with grep is a common pattern for finding specific processes.
      This is useful when you know the process name but not its PID.
    hint: "Try 'ps aux | grep bash' to find bash processes"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "ps aux | grep bash | grep -v grep"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "bash"

  - id: "count-processes"
    title: "Count Running Processes"
    description: |
      Count how many processes are currently running using ps and wc.

      This combines what you've learned: pipe ps output to wc -l to count lines.
      Subtract 1 for the header line to get the actual process count.
    hint: "Use 'ps aux | wc -l' to count all processes (including header)"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "ps aux | wc -l"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: ""
