      Use 'uname -a' to display all system information.

      uname shows system details like kernel name, version, architecture, and hostname.
      The -a flag shows all available information at once.
    hint: "Type 'uname -a' to see complete system information"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "uname -a"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "Linux"

  - id: "check-kernel-version"
    title: "Check Kernel Version"
    description: |
      Use 'uname -r' to display just the kernel version.

      Knowing the kernel version is important for compatibility, troubleshooting,
      and security updates. The -r flag shows only the release version.
    hint: "Try 'uname -r' to see the kernel version"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "uname -r"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: ""

  - id: "check-system-uptime"
    title: "Check System Uptime"
    description: |
      Use the 'uptime' command to see how long the system has been running.

      uptime shows how long since the system was booted, how many users are logged in,
      and the system load average. This is crucial for monitoring system stability.
    hint: "Type 'uptime' to see how long the system has been running"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "uptime"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "up"

  - id: "check-memory-usage"
    title: "Check Memory Usage"
    description: |
      Use 'free -h' to display memory usage in human-readable format.

      free shows total, used, and available memory (RAM and swap). The -h flag
      displays sizes in GB/MB for easier reading. Essential for diagnosing
      performance issues.
    hint: "Use 'free -h' to see memory usage"
    validation:
      type: "command-output"
      command: "free -h | head -n 1"
      matcher: "contains"
      expected: "total"
